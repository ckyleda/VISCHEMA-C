# VISC-C/I

A visual complexity dataset that includes both single-score data as well as two-dimensional annotations of simple and complex regions. Two datasets are included; a collection upright scenes with the aforementioned human data, and a collection of inverted scene images with corresponding complexity ratings.

Blue indicates complex regions, red indicates simple regions.
Ratings scored between 0 (simple) and 100 (complex)

# VISC-C

Upright scene images, complexity scores, and complexity maps. For visualisation purposes, complexity maps normalised by annotation count are available. For data processing purposes, the base maps should be used. 800 Scenes, 800 Complexity scores, 800 Complexity maps

# VISC-CI

Inverted scene images, complexity scores and complexity maps for these inverted scene images.
800 Rotationally Inverted Scenes, 800 Complexity scores, 800 Complexity maps
