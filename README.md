# Brief

A visual complexity dataset that includes both single-score data as well as two-dimensional annotations of simple and complex regions. 
Two datasets are included; a collection upright scenes with the aforementioned human data, and a collection of inverted scene images with corresponding complexity ratings.

# VISC-C/I

This repository contains a dataset for exploring two-dimensional scene complexity perception. One dataset (VISC-C) consists of 800 scene images with 800 corresponding complexity maps that reveal the regions of scenes that human observers find complex 
or simple. The other dataset (VISC-CI) examines complexity perception when the scenes are rotationally inverted, degrading the semantic content of the images. 
Both datasets also contain 800 complexity scores that sum up the overall complexity of the scene. Each dataset was gathered from 40 (disjoint) participants, with each scene image being viewed by 10 observers.

Blue indicates complex regions, red indicates simple regions.
Ratings scored between 0 (simple) and 100 (complex)

# VISC-C

Upright scene images, complexity scores, and complexity maps. For visualisation purposes, complexity maps normalised by annotation count are available. For data processing purposes, the base maps should be used. 800 Scenes, 800 Complexity scores, 800 Complexity maps

# VISC-CI

Inverted scene images, complexity scores and complexity maps for these inverted scene images.
800 Rotationally Inverted Scenes, 800 Complexity scores, 800 Complexity maps
